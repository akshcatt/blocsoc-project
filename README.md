# EduRave : Decentralized Professor Review System

Our project is an innovative decentralized review system designed to provide a transparent and trustworthy platform for evaluating and sharing feedback on professors within educational institutions. Leveraging a combination of web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with blockchain technologies such as Ethereum and Solidity, we have created a robust and secure platform for conducting professor reviews.

## Appendix

Decentralization with Ethereum:
The core of our system relies on Ethereum, a decentralized blockchain platform. This ensures that the review data is stored securely and transparently on the blockchain, eliminating the risk of tampering and ensuring the integrity of the review process.

Smart Contracts in Solidity:
The Ethereum blockchain is empowered by smart contracts written in Solidity. These contracts automate and execute the logic of the review system, handling tasks such as submitting reviews, retrieving review data, and ensuring the fairness and transparency of the entire process.

User-Friendly Frontend:
The frontend of our application is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for students and faculty members to interact with the review system. Users can easily submit reviews, view aggregated scores, and explore feedback on professors.

Ethers.js for Ethereum Interaction:
Ethers.js, a JavaScript library, is utilized to interact with the Ethereum blockchain seamlessly. This allows for the integration of blockchain functionality into our web application, enabling users to interact with smart contracts and access review data in real-time.
